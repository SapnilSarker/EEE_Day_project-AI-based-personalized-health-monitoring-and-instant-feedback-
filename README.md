# EEE_Day_project-AI-based-personalized-health-monitoring-and-instant-feedback
This project presents a real-time health monitoring system that predicts CO₂ levels in the blood and assesses heart conditions using PPG (Photoplethysmography) signals. Built with an ESP32 microcontroller, a pulse sensor, and an OLED display, the system processes PPG data to estimate blood CO₂ concentration and evaluate cardiovascular health, providing real-time feedback to users. By leveraging sensor-based data acquisition, embedded processing, and IoT capabilities, this project offers an accessible and cost-effective solution for personalized health monitoring. Designed for portability, low power consumption, and real-time analysis, it has potential applications in both research and healthcare.
